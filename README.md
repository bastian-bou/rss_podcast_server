# rss_podcast_server
RSS podcast server based on [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en), [Koa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa) and [podcast](https://www.npmjs.com/package/podcast) packages

This project lets you host your own podcast. It creates an RSS feed that can be added to podcast applications and websites.

Simply create a folder containing a podcast description json and a jpeg image for the logo, and add a new folder containing a description json and an AAC audio file for each new episode.

It automatically sorts episodes by date.
